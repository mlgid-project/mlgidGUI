# mlgidGUI
## Project summary

mlgidGUI is a graphical tool for the analysis and annotation of GIWAXS data.
The resulting datasets can be used for training and testing ML models or further manual analysis. 
mlgidGUI is well suited for the annotation of 2D diffraction images with radial symmetry.
In particular, it focuses on grazing-incidence wide-angle scattering data analysis and its specific needs.

## Installation

### Recommended: Precompiled AppImage or EXE
Readily compiled packages for the x64 architecture with Windows and Unix are available at the releases page:
[https://github.com/mlgid-project/mlgidGUI/releases](https://github.com/mlgid-project/mlgidGUI/releases)

To run the program on windows simply double click on the file and ignore the security warnings.


Follow these instructions to run the AppImage: [https://docs.appimage.org/introduction/quickstart.html](https://docs.appimage.org/introduction/quickstart.html)

### Alternative: Installation with conda
* Install miniconda
[https://www.anaconda.com/download/success#miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success#miniconda)
* Create environment
`conda create -n mlgidGUI python=3.8 pip`
* Activate environment
`conda activate mlgidGUI`

Clone with git:

`git clone https://github.com/mlgid-project/mlgidGUI.git`

`cd ./mlgidGUI`

`pip install ./`

`python3 main.py`


## Usage

Import images or H5 files to the program, select the image in the Project Manager and start labeling:
Annotations can be added with the key combination `Ctrl + Alt` and a mouseclick- and hold on the image.
The key combination `Ctrl + H` can be used to hide the annotations. The annotated data  can be exported as PASCAL-VOC 
dataset and H5.
