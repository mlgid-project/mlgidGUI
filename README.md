# _mlgidGUI_
## Project summary

_mlgidGUI_ is a graphical tool for the analysis and annotation of Grazing-Incidence Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS) data.
The resulting datasets can be used for training and testing ML models or further manual analysis. 
_mlgidGUI_ is well suited for the annotation of 2D diffraction images with radial symmetry.
In particular, it focuses on grazing-incidence wide-angle scattering data analysis and its specific needs.

## Installation

### Recommended: Precompiled AppImage or EXE
Readily compiled packages for the x64 architecture with Windows and Unix are available at the releases page:
[https://github.com/mlgid-project/mlgidGUI/releases](https://github.com/mlgid-project/mlgidGUI/releases)

To run the program on Windows simply double click on the file and ignore the security warnings.


Follow these instructions to run the AppImage: [https://docs.appimage.org/introduction/quickstart.html](https://docs.appimage.org/introduction/quickstart.html)

### Alternative: Installation with conda
* Install miniconda
[https://www.anaconda.com/download/success#miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success#miniconda)
* Create environment
`conda create -n mlgidGUI python=3.8 pip`
* Activate environment
`conda activate mlgidGUI`

Clone with git:

`git clone https://github.com/mlgid-project/mlgidGUI.git`

`cd ./mlgidGUI`

`pip install ./`

`python3 main.py`


## Usage

Import images or HDF5 files into the program, select an image in the Project Manager and begin labeling.
To add annotations, hold `Ctrl + Alt`, then click, hold, and drag the mouse over the image, similar to using a shape-drawing tool.
The key combination `Ctrl + H` can be used to hide the annotations. The annotated data  can be exported as PASCAL-VOC 
dataset or as an HDF5 file.

- We added a CIF file, a GIWAXS image, and an HDF5 file in the `docs\example_files` folder to provide the user with examples.
- For a short demonstration of the program usage, please refer to the [Workflow section](./docs/WORKFLOW.md).
- For a detailed guidance, please refer to the [Documentation section](./docs/DOCUMENTATION.md)
